          	<h3>How to believe when you don’t</h3>
            <p><h1>The Prayer</h1>
				Excuse my ignorance for I am just a human,<br>
				and can not begin to understand the greatness and complexity of the great vision for the future of our world.<br>
				Forgive me for my failure to understand and for my lack of knowledge of the vastness of love for life.<br>
				I hope and pray that the vibration of love continues to grow and becomes the one true God for the world.
				<br><br>
				
<h1><strong>Taoism</h1></strong>
<li>The Tao that is the real Tao can not be named. As the river flows so flows the Tao.</li>
<li>By being Tao all things exist, from nothingness the Tao moves.</li>
<li>As the dragon flies so the Tao become visible.</li>
<br>
<h1><strong>Buddhism / Hinduism</h1></strong>
<li>Attachment is the path to suffering, by releasing ourselves from the path of ignorance we become enlightened.</li>
<li>From our enlighten path we become manifest.</li>
<li>From our manifestation of our truth of self we become Buddha.</li>
<br>
<h1><strong>Monotheisms / Polytheism</h1></strong>
<li>We believe in one God, the father the son and the Holy Spirit.</li>
<li>We believe in one lord Jesus Christ the only Son of God.</li> 
<li>Through him all things were made.</li> 
<li>He was born of the Virgin Mary and became a man.</li>
<li>For our sake he was crucified, died and was buried.</li> 
<li>On the third day he rose again.</li>
<br>
<h1><strong>Is’ness and the Zen of being</h1></strong>
<li>Life just is; the being of being.</li>
<li>Within the moment is held the key to ultimate existence.</li>  
<li>To is, is to be. The oneness of being is the is’ness of oneness.</li> 
<li>Zen is the art of being at one with the oneness of being.</li>
<br>
<h1><strong>Science and the modern understanding of life</h1></strong>
<li>I think therefore I am.</li>
<li>If a tree falls in the woods and there is no one to hear it fall does it make a sound?</li>
<li>QED: Quod Erat Demonstrandum. What we wanted to prove.</li>
<li>If A is true and B is true and C is bound by A and B then C must also be true.</li>
<br>
<h1><strong>Our relationship with our own belief’s as they impact our lives</h1></strong>
<li>How our lives are defined by our belief of what our life is about.</li>
<li>How our own belief is the key to our understanding of the self.</li>
<li>And how refocusing our belief into new ways of looking at life we can change our life into the life we truly want.</li>
