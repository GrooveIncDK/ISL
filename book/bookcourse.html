                  What you are attempting to achieve by this course, is a state of inner 
                  peace and happiness. Your journey is one of self discovery and self 
                  understanding. Many people see happiness as unachievable and as something 
                  that only comes in short periods or glimpse. But happiness and inner peace 
                  can be a permanent state of being that you can stay in your entire life.
                  <br>
						However, you must realise that this is not something that you can achieve 
						in a few short weeks. What you have come to understand and expect from your 
						own experiences has shown you that once you fix a problem it is fixed. This 
						is not the case with your inner self, nor is it the case for your karma. 
						The search for happiness requires hard work. And this is where it begins. 
						<br><br><strong>Duration:</strong><br> Approximately 3 hours per week in 14 weeks, 
						see the full course plan <a href="/courses/courses1-outline.html">here</a>

					 <dd><strong>Happy business is good business </strong><br>
						We all know that when we are happy we have more energy, we get more good 
						ideas, we create fewer conflicts and we are feeling better physical as 
						well as mental. Therefore it can not be surprising that a company with 
						happy employees functions better than a company with unhappy and frustrated employees.
						<br>
						Can we learn to be happy without reason even if everything around us is 
						in confusion? Yes we can! This course is a step by step guide into how 
						to get a happy life both when we are at work and when we are off. It is 
						not something that comes easy, it requires hard work and can be achieved 
						by everybody no matter what their background is.
