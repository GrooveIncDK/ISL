                <dd><strong>The Science of Happiness</strong><br>
						Is happiness something we are born with or without, something we need to 
						earn or is it something we can achieve if we decide to? Is there a scientific 
						way to find happiness, Where you can systemically follow a process of 
						understanding that  will lead to guaranteed happiness? 
						<br><br>
						The answer is clear and concise: Happiness comes from within and is independent 
						of outer circumstances. It is a condition we can all achieve and live in permanently, 
						if we are willing to change certain things in our perspective and way of living. 
						The Science of Happiness introduces how to change your life view and thereby achieve 
						inner peace and fill your life with happiness and positivity.<br>
						Without being to technical The Science of Happiness introduces concepts like belief 
						and spirituality from a scientific perspective, which gives a clear and tangible 
						understanding of what it means to be in contact with your higher-self and the shared 
						consciousness of the universe.
						<br><br>
						Everybody can become happy by using the science of Happiness, it is just a question 
						of an open mind and willingness to change.

                  professional people as well as providing lectures on how to improve our quality of
