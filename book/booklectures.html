                    <dd><strong>The Science of Happiness</strong><br>
                  A lecture about how “you” via simple tools can change your life 
                  and live in true happiness. For many, happiness is associated with 
                  an unrealistic state of being that can only be achieve for small glimpses in time. 
                  <br>
						We see a world full of chaos and pain, with all that life presents us it 
						is hard to imagine a permanent state of happiness within. But the reality 
						is, we all have a choice: Do we want to live a truly happy life or do we 
						want to live with fear and anxiety? By changing our perspective and view on 
						life we are more likely to see the positive in other people and situations, 
						and we can change our attitude to the challenges we face so life becomes a 
						stream of instructive experiences instead of tragic incidents. Further more 
						the lecture gives an insight into what it means in our life when we learn to 
						be grateful.<br>
						The lecture gives an introduction to how you can change your life. It is possible 
						for everybody to change, but change does not come with one day..
                  <br><br>
						<strong>Duration:</strong> 3 hours (inclusive meditation and break)

					 <dd><strong>Happy business is good business</strong><br>
						We all know that when we are happy we have more energy, 
						we get more good ideas, we create fewer conflicts and we 
						feel better physically and mentally. Therefore it can not 
						be surprising that a company with happy employees functions 
						better than a company with unhappy and frustrated employees.
						<br>
						Can we learn to be happy without reason even if everything 
						around us is in confusion? Yes we can! The lecture 
						'Happy business is good business' introduces how, by changing 
						rigid habits and lifestyles one can bring happiness into their 
						life as a permanent state of being, and how this can change 
						and lift the company culture with benefits and joy for everybody.
