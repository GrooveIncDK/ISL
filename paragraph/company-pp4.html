            <h2>The Law of Attraction</h2>
            <div class="list und">    
               The Law of Attraction has become a very popular phrase during the past few years. This is 
               partially because of the movie and the book; The Secret, which have made many people realize 
               that they can create their own lives and the things that they receive. 
					<br><br>
					The lecture is a step-by-step walk through the Law of Attraction and how we create our own world 
					and the things that we have. It will help to explain to you, why your life is as it is, and how 
					you can attract more of that which you truly want and less of that which you would rather be 
					without. The Law of Attraction is not a new concept, it has been known for thousands of years, 
					and we know that Henry Ford, Sir Isaac Newton and Dr Albert Einstein were acquainted with this 
					phenomenon. Learn how you can change your life and attract all that you really want.
