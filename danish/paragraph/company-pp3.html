            <h2>Science versus Spirituality</h2>
            <div class="list und">  
					For many years it has been; science or spirituality. They have been two incompatible things 
					and you had to choose whether you were on one 'side' or the other. Today, Science has developed 
					to the point where it is actually possible to measure and test theories on and about spirituality. 
					That which was sheer hocus-pocus can now be scientifically argued and explained via quantum physics 
					and other such studies. It is possible to measure the energies/vibrations that human beings 
					radiate and in so doing, substantiate how this affects our surroundings and the observer. 
					<br>Come and listen to a talk about that which many people still thinks is impossible. 
					<br>Hear how we affect our universe and how that affects our lives and how little it takes to change the world.
