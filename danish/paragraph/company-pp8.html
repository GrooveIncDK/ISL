					How do you, with very simple techniques, change your business into a happier workplace?
					<br>For many people happiness is associated with an unrealistic state that can only 
					obtain momentarily and is unsustainable.
					<br><br>
					We see our world as full of chaos and evil, we can not imagine how to be happy with 
					all that we are presented throughout life. 
					<br>However, the reality is; we all have a choice:
					<br> Do we want to live a truly happy life or do we want to live with fear and anger. 
					By changing our view of the world and life, we can attract positive people and events 
					and we can change our attitude towards the challenges we are being exposed to, so that 
					they will become educational experiences rather than tragic events.
					<br><br>
					The lecture provides an introduction to how you can change your life. 
					<br>That it is possible for everyone, and that it is not something you can learn in a day.
					<br><br>
					<strong>Duration: 3 hours (inc. breaks & meditations) </strong>
					<br>
					<strong>Price: 8000,- DKK</strong>
