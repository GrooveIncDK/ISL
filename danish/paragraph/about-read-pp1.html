            </h3>
            <h1>
				ISL is a modern institute set-up to accommodate the need for a better understanding in matters pertaining to the spiritual self. The objective of every human-being on this small planet is to better understand themselves. We have accumulated, over the past 4000 years, a complete unabridged version of the knowledge of life. ISL has begun the task of organising this information into clearly understandable sections of human reasoning.
				By not excluding any ideas developed by the human mind, and by including all possible paradigms, ISL has been able to correlate and index the main similarities between all forms for understanding.
				The Institute of Spiritual Learning has for many years, been developing a clearer understanding of the needs of its students. And without their dedication the development of our school would not have been possible.
