                What you are attempting to achieve with this course is a state of inner peace and happiness.
					 Your journey is one of self discovery and self understanding. However, you must realise that 
					 this is not something that you can achieve in a few short weeks.
					<br />
					 This is very important to remember, as the real tasks for your self development comes with 
					 the implementation of what you have learned on the course.
					 Each of the work sheets gives you a clear description of the steps you must go through to 
					 come into contact with your higher self, this type of exercise is a little counter intuitive. 
					 What you have come to understand and expect from your own experiences has shown you that once 
					 you fix a problem it is fixed. This is not the case with your inner self, nor is it the case for your karma.
