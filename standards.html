              <p><li><strong><h1 id="standard1">Excellence</h1></strong></li>       
               Excellence is a prerequisite for any courses undertaken at ISL.<br>
					The demands on the individual in today's environment require that a certain amount of flexibility 
					is accepted. This is an unacceptable situation, excellence has only one goal. It is with these 
					things in mind that we expect a level of excellence from our students and clients. Excellence 
					is your objective! 
                <br>
					<br />    
					<li><strong><h1 id="standard2">Achievement above cost</h1></strong></li>       
               How much do you value your existence, our dedication to you exceeding your own achievements 
               is our objective.<br>
					Every task tests you, and there are things that have to be sacrificed. The purpose of this 
					is to let go of the old processes and the old habits. The cost, feels like more than you can 
					afford, the institute will take from you things that you don't want to give up.<br />
					That is the achievement. 
                <br>
					<br />
					<li><strong><h1 id="standard3">Knowledge & Understanding</h1></strong></li>       
                Spirituality: is the understanding of psychology coupled with the knowledge of God. Knowledge 
                of God is the understanding of the self coupled with the belief in a higher power. Belief in a higher 
                power is the understanding that you are always safe and always on the right path.<br>
                The Institute of Spiritual Learning teaches Knowledge & Understanding.
                <br>
					<br />
					<li><strong><h1 id="standard4">'Nosce te Ipsum' - Know Thyself</h1></strong></li>       
               We are not human beings having a spiritual experience: we are spiritual beings having a human experience.<br>
					To know yourself is to be yourself, the institute of spiritual learning is committed to giving 
					you the tools with which to discover who you are and how you can better become your true self. 
					Dedication to your personal development is of the highest importance to us.  
                <br>
					<br />
					<li><strong><h1 id="standard5">Accept nothing but the truth</h1></strong></li>       
              	The truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me God.<br>
              	The Institute of Spiritual Learning can promise truth and honesty, can you?<br> If you are looking 
              	for a system that will allow you to continue lying to yourself and a system that will keep 
              	giving you the excuses not to change, then look somewhere else! ISL will not accept time wasters, 
              	excuse makers and anyone that does not really want to change. ISL welcomes people that have 
              	made the right choice, ISL welcomes you the individual to the greatest experience of your life. 
              	Self discovery, Spiritual discovery.
